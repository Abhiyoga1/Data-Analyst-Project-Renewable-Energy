In this project we want to know how the development of renewable energy in Indonesia and then how is the comparison of it's development to neighboring & developed country.
The tools that we will use to prepare,analyst, and visualize the data are using python and excel. Following these inquiries, we need to investigate them, then extract insights from the visualized data.
1. How are the renewable energy sources in Indonesia's electricity generation throughout the year?
2. How is the distribution of renewable energy sources in Indonesia's electricity generation in recent years?
3. How does renewable energy generation in Indonesia compare to that of neighboring countries throughout the year?
4. How does renewable energy generation in Indonesia compare to that of develop countries throughout the year?
5. How does the comparison of Indonesia's distribution of renewable energy with neighboring countries look in recent years?
6. How does the comparison of Indonesia's distribution of renewable energy with develop countries look in recent years?
